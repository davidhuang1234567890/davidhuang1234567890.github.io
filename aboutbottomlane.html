<h3>Bottom Lane</h3>
<img class="botlanepicture" src="adcarry.jpg" alt="this is a picture about the ADC position in league of legends">
<p>ADC (Attack Damage Carry) is an archaic term used to refer to a champion that deals strong, continuous damage.
    They deal damage with their basic attacks and scales with attack-related stats - i.e. attack damage, critical strike chance and attack speed. </p>
<p>Some of the Champions are considered ADCs are:
    <ul>
        <li>Kaisa</li>
        <li>Draven</li>
        <li>Xayah</li>
        <li>Miss Fortune</li>
        <li>etc..</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> Support is a champion that supports the ADC in lane so the ADC doesnt get killed. Adc generally is a weak champion early game but scales to late game.
    So the support's job is to not let the ADC die.
</p>
<p>Some of these Champions are used to play the support role are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Janna</li>
    <li>Blitzcrank</li>
    <li>Thresh</li>
    <li>Lulu</li>
    <li>All Champions (if the players know what they are doing)</li>
</ul>
