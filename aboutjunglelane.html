<h4>Jungle</h4>
<img class="jungle" src="junglecamps.jpg" alt="this is a map of the jungle in league of legends">
<p>Jungling is the practice of killing neutral "Monsters" located on some maps between the lanes. 
    Jungle refers to any area of the map that is not a lane or part of either team's base, including the river that divides it. 
    Junglers rely on killing neutral monsters in the jungle to keep up with their laning teammates in terms of gold and experience. 
    In a standard 5-on-5 game of League of Legends, 4 players on a team will be Laners, and 1 player will be a designated Jungler.</p> 
<p>some of the champions that are played as junglers are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shyvana</li>
    <li>Master yi</li>
    <li>Nunu</li>
    <li>Rengar</li>
</ul>
