<h2>Mid Lane</h2>
<img class="right" src="midlane.png" alt="this a picture of the middle lane in League of Legends">
<p>Its the most influential lane in the game (the most influential role is jungler). A mid laner can roam top, bot, or invade any jungle quadrant.

    Mid is the shortest lane so it became the default place for squishies without escapes (mages) and their counters (assassins).
    
    Its a solo lane so you're not dependent on a support like the other glass cannon role (ADC).
    
    Mid lane is often seen as the most skillful lane. When top lane's balance is always unbalanced, and bot lane is always a fiesta, mid lane is the place you can get a decent 1v1.
    
    Its the most exciting lane according to most people.</p>

<p>Mid lane's champion pool contains burst mages and assassins. Burst mages are champions which have a high ability power damage and relied on their abilities.
assassins are champions that can one-shot champions but required a higher amount of skillplay. </p>
